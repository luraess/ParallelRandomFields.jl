# ParallelRandomFields.jl
Efficient parallel random field generator for large 3-D problems

![3D random fields with Gaussian and exponential covariance](docs/Fig_exp_gauss_3D.png)

ParallelRandomFields enables to sample spatial realisations of a 3-D random fields with given power spectrum. The method allows for fast and accurate generation of Gaussian random fields with anisotropic exponential (left figure pane) and isotropic Gaussian (right figure pane) covariance functions. The method is fast, accurate and fully local. We use ParallelStencil to provide an architecture-agnostic high-level CPU and GPU implementation, and ImplicitGlobalGrid for a multi-XPU support (distributed memory parallelisation).

The implementation builds upon an approach proposed in\[[1][Raess2019]\] and employs a parallel implementation of the method based on spectral representation described in \[[2][Sabelfeld1991]\]. Advantages of this method are the possibility of random field simulation on an arbitrary grid and the simplicity of parallel implementation of the algorithm. The method is flexible and is also applicable for arbitrary anisotropic spectrum.

## Module documentation callable from the Julia REPL / IJulia
The module documentation can be called from the [Julia REPL] or in [IJulia]:
```julia-repl
julia> using ParallelRandomFields
julia>?
help?> ParallelRandomFields
```

## Usage
ParallelRandomFields can be interactively executed within the [Julia REPL]. Note that for optimal performance the script should be launched from the shell using the project's dependencies `--project`, disabling array bound checking `--check-bounds=no`, and using optimization level 3 `-O3`.
```sh
$ julia --project --check-bound=no -O3 <script>.jl
```

Note: refer to the documentation of your Supercomputing Centre for instructions to run Julia at scale. Instructions for running on the Piz Daint GPU supercomputer at the [Swiss National Supercomputing Centre](https://www.cscs.ch/computers/piz-daint/) can be found [here](https://user.cscs.ch/tools/interactive/julia/) and for running on the octopus GPU supercomputer at the [Swiss Geocomputing Centre](https://wp.unil.ch/geocomputing/octopus/) can be found [here](https://gist.github.com/luraess/45a7a4059d8ace694812e7e301f1a258).

## Dependencies
ParallelRandomFields relies on [ParallelStencil.jl] and [ImplicitGlobalGrid.jl], which build upon [CUDA.jl] and [MPI.jl].

## Installation
ParallelRandomFields may be installed directly with the [Julia package manager](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/stdlib/Pkg/index.html) from the REPL:
```julia-repl
julia>]
  pkg> add https://github.com/luraess/ParallelRandomFields.jl
```
